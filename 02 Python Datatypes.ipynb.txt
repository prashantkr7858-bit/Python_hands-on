    "Okay, let's break down Python's built-in **Numeric Types** (`int`, `float`, `complex`) in detail, including their common operations and functions, with 10 examples for each, using the Edukron context where possible.\n",

    "## Python Built-in Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers three distinct built-in numeric types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`int` (Integer):** Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) without a fractional part. In Python 3, integers have arbitrary precision, meaning they can grow as large as your system's memory allows.\n",
    "2.  **`float` (Floating-Point Number):** Represents real numbers, including those with a fractional part indicated by a decimal point or scientific notation (e.g., `1.5e3` for 1500.0). Floats typically use the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision representation, which can sometimes lead to small precision inaccuracies.\n",
    "3.  **`complex` (Complex Number):** Represents numbers with a real and an imaginary part. The imaginary part is denoted by a `j` or `J` suffix (e.g., `3+5j`). While less common in general data metrics, they are crucial in many scientific and engineering domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your examples:\n",
    "*   `total_students = 1500` is an `int`.\n",
    "*   `average_rating = 4.8` is a `float`.\n",
    "*   `growth_projection = complex(10, 3)` (or `10+3j`) is a `complex` number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. `int` (Integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Integers represent whole numbers. They are fundamental for counting, indexing, and representing discrete quantities like the number of students, courses, or batches.\n",

    "### 2. `tuple`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Tuples are **immutable** (unchangeable), ordered sequences of items. They are defined using parentheses `()`, with items separated by commas. Like lists, they can contain items of different data types. Because they are immutable, they are often used for fixed collections of items and can be used as keys in dictionaries (whereas lists cannot).\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuples support indexing, slicing, `len()`, and membership testing (`in`, `not in`) just like lists. However, they lack methods that modify the tuple (like `append`, `remove`, `sort`, etc.). They have only two primary methods: `count()` and `index()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Represents an **immutable** sequence of bytes (integers between 0 and 255). Created using a `b` prefix before a string literal (e.g., `b'hello'`) or the `bytes()` constructor. String literals within `b''` must typically be ASCII-compatible; for other encodings, use `.encode()`.\n",
